ABOUT
-----
This program reads in a file, 'state.txt', and then proceeds to store the contents of the file
into a 2d array. The program then applies a series of rules to determine the state of the gameboard.
When the program is done, a game log will print to the console consisting of the history of the game including
player name, the date, and the number of generations that the game ran.
