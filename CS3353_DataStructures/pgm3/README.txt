I am submitting 4 .java files. Three of my files are my 
main hash tables. The fourth is a HashNode class that 
stores the information at each index of the table.


HashChain.java

This class uses chaining to handle collisions. This class
rejects duplicates and terminates when each index in the 
hash table has been filled.

USAGE: java HashChain [fileName]




HashProbe.java

This class uses probing to handle collisions. This class
rejects duplicates and terminates when each index in the 
hash table has been filled.

USAGE: java HashProbe [fileName]




HashDoubleHash.java

This class uses double hashing to handle collisions. This class
rejects duplicates and terminates when each index in the 
hash table has been filled.

USAGE: java HashDoubleHash [fileName]
