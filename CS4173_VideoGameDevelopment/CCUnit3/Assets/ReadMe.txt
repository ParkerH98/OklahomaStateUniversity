Completed Components: All
Completed Bonus: Yes
Remaining Bugs/Issues: Minor: 
I didn't have any bugs or issues with the program. However, my executable is having issues.
For some reason, the program runs perfect in the Unity editor, but when I build and run the exec it doesn't perform as expected. The balloon
just floats to the ground and hits a bomb and the game immediately ends. I have no clue why this is happening. I tried resaving and rebuilding 
the project approx. 5 times.
