This is my partial prototype for Ultimate Racquetball. As of now, the player is able to move 
around the court and hit the ball in the direction of their mouse. There are still many things
left to be implemented on this project. I will give the status of the components of this project.

Player Movement: Works but the player goes through walls for some reason
Player Jump: done
Ball Physics: works but needs further tuning
Hitting the Ball: works but needs further tuning
Aiming the Ball: doesn't work that well yet
AI: haven't started 
Different Difficulties: haven't started 
Stats Upgrade Screen: haven't started 
Final Game Logic: Haven't started yet
