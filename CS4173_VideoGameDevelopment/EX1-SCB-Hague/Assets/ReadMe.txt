Issues: Bonus -- Can only switch cameras a finite number of times. I couldn't figure
out why it wont let me continually switch them.

Bugs: None
Parts Not Completed: None

Bonus:
I did the bonus on this problem. You can switch the cameras by pressing F and the camera can look around
with the arrow keys and move with the space bar.
