    "\n",
    "The learning rate, though important, didn't seem to have as big as an effect when using the Adam optimizer. For example, the validation accuracies for .001, .0001, and .01 learning rates were respectively .963, .961, and .958. This shows that there was only a .005 accuracy difference from the lowest to the highest accuracies. This indicates that at least when using the Adam optimizer on this specific problem, the learning rate doesn't have a huge impact on the validation accuracy. The best overall learning rate proved to be .001.\n",

    "## Question 2\n",

    "The batch size does have a bigger impact on the validation accuracy than the learning rate did. I tested 4 different batch sizes ([64, 128, 512, 1024]) and there was a much larger .045 difference from the highest validation accuracy to the lowest. The best batch size from the set proved to be 512 with about .68 validation accuracy.\n",

The convolutional model has 22.06 times more parameters than feed forward model and achieves a 84.24% increase in model accuracy. I think this increase in parameters is worth the increase in validation accuracy; especially since the training time still didn't take that long.\n",
