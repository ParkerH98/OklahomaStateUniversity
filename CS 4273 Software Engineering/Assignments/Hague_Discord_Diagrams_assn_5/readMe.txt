Report For Parker Hague's Diagrams


Social Media App: Discord


1: Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram models different functionalities and uses for different kinds of users. In this diagram I have shown various actions that a signed-in and unsigned-in user can perform such as creating messages, starting calls, and sharing a screen. Discord is made that anyone can use the app, but actual members get more features in the app. You can see in this diagram that a signed-in user has a more capabilities than a user that isn't signed in. Again, this model is showing the call and message features along with the screen sharing.


2: Sequence Diagram
In this diagram I covered the sequence of what happens when a message is successfully sent in Discord. Sending messages is one of the main features of Discord and a big reason why people use the platform. I did not handle failure messages as that is a completely separate process with various extra steps. In this diagram, you can see the order of events over time as a message is sent on Discord.


3: Activity Diagram
For the activity diagram, I covered the Discord login functionality. This login is fairly similar to most other apps. The user gets a chance to sign in. If they don't have an account, they can create one. I showed the process of events as a user tries to login and is either accepted or denied. The user is then either redirected to the home page or the user will have an option to create an
account and try again.
