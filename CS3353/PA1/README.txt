I was having issues with connecting to CSX server. I am emailing
my .java files just in case I don't get to connect to CSX servers
before the deadline.


I have submitted four different programs.


DoublyLinkedList.java

Stack.java

CircularQueue.java

Matching.java


Each program will work with file input. The input is as follows:

java [NameOfProgram.java] [.txt file name]
