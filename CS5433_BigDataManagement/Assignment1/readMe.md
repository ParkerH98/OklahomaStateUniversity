# Important Note
The primary assignment work is in part 2 and part 3. I only included part1 and hashCount
because they were other files I made to help me. The main directories to be graded should be 
part2 and part3.

# Contents
- part1 - helper code to view directory and print file
- part2 - counts number of tweets using MapReduce
- part3 - counts hashtags and partitions reduce jobs
- hashCount - helper code to see total hashtags
